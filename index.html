            <h2>Know Our Global Community</h2>
            <p>Global Communities is an international non-profit organization that works closely with communities
                worldwide to bring about sustainable changes that improve the lives and livelihoods of the
                vulnerable.Connecting to the global community fosters education, collaboration, and the birth of
                mutually-beneficial programs that make an impact. On the micro level, keeping oneself connected to the
                global community requires a conscious decision. We can easily live inside a bubble without us even
                knowing it. </p>

            <h2> Peace ,Dignity and Identity</h2>
            <p> As the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost
                forum to
                address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting
                alone.

                To its initial goals of safeguarding peace, protecting human rights, establishing the framework for
                international justice and promoting economic and social progress, in the seven decades since its
                creation
                the United Nations has added on new challenges, such as AIDS, big data and climate change.

                While conflict resolution and peacekeeping continue to be among its most visible efforts, the UN, along
                with
                its specialized agencies, is also engaged in a wide array of activities to improve people’s lives around
                the
                world – from disaster relief, through education and advancement of women, to peaceful uses of atomic
                energy.

                This website offers an overview of some of these issues, and links to other resources, where you can get
                additional information.</p>
